<h3> Results </h3>
As a result of the overall project there has been:
<uo>
<li>Crawled computer science conference pages and downlaoded conference speakers images (904)</li>
<li>Created web application tool where human ratings for the speakers attractivness were gathered</li>
<li>Generated plots showing the distribution and corelation of the scores from humans and automated scoring for the attractivness</li>
